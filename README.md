# My C Header Libraries

This is a repository of all my custom C header libraries. This is provided "as-is", they
should all work but if there are any problems you can e-mail me. My e-mail address is
below.

## Extra Thoughts

Well, the more functions I think of the more I'll make. So if you think of any that would
be useful just send me a message explain what the function should do.

## SDL2 Library (Included for Windows)

The SDL2 library I have included is the one from https://libsdl.org/ so, all credits for
SDL2 go to the guys/gals who made it. But all of my examples and my header libraries are mine. Just NOT the SDL2 library.
